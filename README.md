This project aims to predict the price of a taxi trip using machine learning, specifically the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. It involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and visualization. The dataset used contains information about taxi trips, including features like time of day, day of week, and etc.
